      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm in the process of learning web development</p>
      <h1>I'm from the Kansas City area </h1>
      <p>For the past 6 years I've been living in St Louis but have recently moved home to Kansas City.</p>
      <h1>My hobbies include...</h1>
      <p>Playing pool, riding bikes, motorcycles, and anything computer related. </p>
      <h1>My dream job is to be a developer.</h1>
      <p>I recieved my bachelor's in Geology at NWMSU in 2013. I initially had doubts over whether I had made the right decision and would keep coming back to the idea of programming over the following years. I was always worried that it was too late or that I would be too far behind. I've now realised its far better to try and fail than to regret not trying at all. </p>
      <h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
      <p>I enjoy problem solving and creating things. Both of which are a big part of programming. I also enjoy the flexibility that would come with a career in the computer sciences. As a Geologist I had limited choices in locations where I could work. Programmers, on the other hand, are needed just about everywhere..   </p>
